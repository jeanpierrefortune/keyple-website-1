(Please refer to this file for more information).\nAlthough symlink support should be provided out of the box for Unix users, Windows users should be aware that the git option core.symlinks needs to be enabled before cloning this repo. Several solutions can be considered:\n When installing git for Windows, an option Enable symbolic links can be choosen. If it has not been enabled and you want to set it via the installer, a reinstallation is needed If you do not want to reinstall git, this option can be enabled afterward via the command line git config core.symlinks true Also, the option can be enabled once only for this specific cloning operation with git clone -c core.symlinks=true REPO_URL  It is important to note that for this option to be actually working, the Windows user needs to have the SeCreateSymbolicLink permission: a user with admin rights is typically granted with this permission.\nImport keyple components with Gradle When using gradle, it is fairly simple to import Keyple components into your project.

For example, a smart reader could be a terminal, a portable scanning laser gun, or a swipe tablet area that is embedded into a door, vehicle or gate. Code is written for a terminal to set the parameters for allowing cards or apps to transmit ticketing information data. Sometimes in a distributed architecture system design, the code for the reader is not on the terminal, but in a cloud environment, so the reader sends the data to cloud-based architecture. Ticketing application: This is behind-the-scenes code that is able to take the data from the smart reader terminal and, in milliseconds real-time, analyze the balance of the ticket, confirm the permissions for entry, and update the data on the ticket (for example, to confirm that the ticket holder can enter the gate or vehicle, and then to deduct the cost of the journey and calculate the new balance).  According to this scheme, Keyple defines two layers:\n SE readers are integrated through plugins implementing the SE Proxy API which manages the communications with a contactless secure element through ant type of contactless reader (local, remote, standard, proprietary…) Ticketing applications relies on a high-level Calypso processing API to manage Calypso commands \u0026amp; security features. This API uses the SE Proxy API to communicate with the reader  Keyple comes with dedicated plugins that integrate directly with smartcard readers that have been built on standard software interfaces including PC/ SC, Android NFC, and Android OMAPI.\nIn cases where there is a distributed architecture design, Keyple includes a Remote Secure Element API plugin so that a smartcard terminal can be operated remotely, as if it were local to the terminal, and ensures that robust security and speed is not sacrificed in a cloud-based system.\nThe Calypso Processing API is also available as a Keyple extension. This component carries out the terminal processing element of ticketing technology. Access to Calypso’s security features are automatically managed by the Keyple extension.\n","date":1597104000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597178635,"objectID":"7aaa147cd90ed6323e3729ae3fcc5811","permalink":"/keyple-website/what-is-keyple-page/main-features/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/keyple-website/what-is-keyple-page/main-features/","section":"what-is-keyple-page","summary":"Keyple makes contactless ticketing accessible.","tags":null,"title":"Keyple's main features","type":"what-is-keyple-page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction Overview Keyple SDK is supported by the Operating System Android.

Once a plugin is provided, any classic Android application can use Keyple to provide ticketing features.\nThis Guide will describe how to start a ticketing application using Keyple SDK.\nCompatibility  Android OS 19+  Integration SDK Integration Keyple Core This high-level API is convenient for developers implementing smart card processing application for terminal interfaced with smart card readers. Access to the readers is provided by the plugins.\nTo use Keyple core API (and in fact, anything keyple\u0026rsquo;s related) import the jar within the gradle dependencies of your Android application.\nimplementation \u0026quot;org.eclipse.keyple:keyple-java-core:$keyple_version\u0026quot;  Please refer to Architecture/Keyle Core\nKeyple Plugins There are many Keyple plugins available, the one to use depends on the device and ticketing tools you are aiming to use.\nFor a standard device the keyple-android-plugin-nfc and keyple-android-plugin-omapi should be be used. They will allow keyple to connect to, respectively, a smart card in the NFC field of the device or, a smart card inserted in a SIM like port. The plugins for Android are Android Libraries (AAR).\nTo use the plugins simply import it within the gradle dependencies of your Android application.\nimplementation \u0026quot;org.eclipse.keyple:keyple-android-plugin-omapi:$keyple_version\u0026quot;  Keyple Calypso The Keyple Calypso User API is an extension of the Keyple Core User API to manage Calypso Portable Object securely using Calypso SAM.\nPlease refer to Architecture/Keyle Calypso\nTo use Keyple Calypso User API simply import the jar within the gradle dependencies of your Android application.\nimplementation \u0026quot;org.eclipse.keyple:keyple-android-plugin-omapi:$keyple_version\u0026quot;  Initializing the SDK Register a plugin The Singleton SeProxyService is the entry point of the SE Proxy Service, its instance has to be called by a ticketing application in order to establish a link with a SE’s application.\nIn order to access to SE we have to register at least one plugin.\noverride fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) /* register Omapi Plugin to the SeProxyService */ try { SeProxyService.getInstance().registerPlugin(AndroidOmapiPluginFactory(this)) } catch (e: KeyplePluginInstantiationException) { /* do something with it */ } }  Retrieve the readers With the plugin registered we can retrieve all instance of the component mapping the smartcard readers provided by this plugins.

Otherwise if the reader is “observable”, the operating of a “default selection”: in this case a default selection request is defined on the reader, the terminal observes the reader, and wait to be notified by the reader about a SE insertion and selection.  At the end the terminal gets a selected SE, it can follow by operating APDU commands with the selected SE until the communication channel is kept open.\nThen a Keyple Core extension could be used to operates APDU commands with the selected SE solution.\n The Keyple Calypso extension provides a high-level API to defined ticketing processing involving Calypso cards, cf.: “Keyple Calypso User Guide”.\n Secure Element Proxy Service API – readers management Using the Keyple Core, Secure Element Readers (SeReader) are managed through plugins (ReaderPlugin).\nThe active plugins are registered to the SE Proxy Service (the singleton SeProxyService).\n Each plugin is registered through a unique name to the SE Proxy Service. Each reader of a plugin is also defined with a unique name inside the plugin.  Plugin setting To secure the usage of the SE Proxy API for the development of terminal applications, the internal implementation of plugins (classes SpecificPluginImpl \u0026amp; SpecificReaderImpl) is hidden.\n For a specific plugin, only the plugin \u0026amp; reader interfaces (SpecificPlugin \u0026amp; SpecificReader) and the factory (class SpecificPluginFactory) are public. The factory of a plugin is set to register a specific plugin to the SE Proxy Service.  Most of plugins of local readers of Keyple are defined as singleton with a unique instance (e.g.: PC/SC, Android NFC, Android OMAPI, most of embedded readers).\nFor the Remote SE plugin defined to manage remote readers, specific plugin instances are created for each communication interfaces.\nSE readers’ access The SE Proxy Service allows to get all the list of the active plugins. A specific plugin could also be directly recovered through its name.\nIn the same way, a plugin can provide the list of all the plugged readers.\nDepending on the native reader technology, some specific parameters could be defined at the plugin or reader level.\nFor a classic plugin, the number of readers is determinate, all the plugged readers of the plugin are directly available for the SE Proxy Service.\nSupport of reader farm or HSM For systems based on a centralized security, in order to manage multiple remote terminal in parallel, central servers could requires to interface a huge number (several hundreds or thousands) of SE through a farm of readers or HSM (Hardware Security Module: an electronic board able to emulate multiple SE).\n The multitude of embedded SE could be divided in different groups of profiles. An HSM is often shared between several services, so the full set of readers isn\u0026rsquo;t directly available for a service, a service has to request the allocation of a reader from a specific group.  The SE Proxy Service could support reader farm or HSM though plugins managing \u0026ldquo;pool\u0026rdquo; of readers (ReaderPoolPlugin).\n At the initialization, the list of reader is empty. The list is be filled depending on the reader allocations requested. When not more required, a reader could be released from the pool.  All plugins have to implement the interface ReaderPlugin and SeReader. A plugin managing a pool of reader should implement in addition the interface ReaderPoolPlugin.\nSE presence check \u0026amp; “explicit selection transaction” A SE reader has the capability to check is a SE is present or not.\n For SE terminal processing for which the presence of a SE in a reader is \u0026ldquo;static' during a transaction, the transaction starts in general with the verification of the SE presence. If the SE is present, the transaction can continue with the selection of the SE. We call this kind of transaction: an \u0026ldquo;explicit selection transaction\u0026rdquo;.\n Plugin \u0026amp; Reader events For some SE terminal, the processing is dynamically driven by the insertion/remove of a SE in a reader, or by the plug/unplug of a reader.\nE.g., in transportation, the ticketing transaction of access control gates is often started when a contactless card is detected in the field of the reader. For that, in Keyple, a SE reader or a plugin has to be observable.\nA plugin could be optionally observable (by implementing ObservablePlugin).\n In this case a terminal application could observe the plugin (by implementing PluginObserver) in order to be notified (PluginEvent) when a new reader is plugged to the plugin, or when a referenced reader is unplugged. To receive the notification of a specific plugin, the plugin observer should first be added to the observer list of the observable plugin.  Depending on the capability of the plugin, a reader could be optionally observable (by implementing ObservableReader).\n A terminal application could observe the plugin (by implementing ReaderObserver) in order to be notified (ReaderEvent) when a SE is inserted or removed from a specific. The reader observer should be added to the observer list to receive the notifications the observable reader.  By default, an observable reader notifies only the insertion or the remove of a SE.\nPlugin observability activation An observable plugin automatically starts to observe plugin events when at least one plugin observer is registered and stops the listening when the last plugin observer is removed.\nAutomatic selection \u0026amp; “default selection transaction” On an observable reader, there is in addition the possibility to define a \u0026ldquo;default selection operation\u0026rdquo;: in this case, when a SE is inserted, the observable reader tries automatically to select the inserted SE using the defined default setting.\n If the inserted SE is successfully selected, then the observable reader notifies that \u0026ldquo;an inserted SE has matched the default selection\u0026rdquo; and provides the corresponding response. Otherwise if the observable reader failed to select the inserted SE, it could just notify that a SE has been inserted.   For SE terminal for which the processing is \u0026ldquo;dynamically\u0026rdquo; driven by the presence of a SE in a reader, the transaction starts in general with the detection of the insertion of a SE and its automatic selection. The reader observer is then notified to analyze the response of the selected SE, and to continue the transaction with the SE. We call this kind of transaction: a \u0026ldquo;default selection transaction\u0026rdquo;.\n Reader notification modes If no default selection is defined, an observable reader notifies its observers for “SE insertion” (whatever the SE detected) or “SE removed” events. A default selection could be defined for the “always” or the \u0026ldquo;matched only” notification mode.\n In the always mode, if the inserted matches the default selection, the observers are notified about a “SE matched” event, otherwise an “SE insertion” event is notified. In case of \u0026ldquo;matched only” mode, the observable reader doesn’t notify SE insertion event. The reader observer will be notified only if a default selection succeed on the observable reader; this configuration allows the reader observer to skip the processing of wrong SE insertions.  Reader observability activation, “polling mode” \u0026amp; “SE removal procedure” For an observable reader, the listening of reader event requires also the registration of at least one reader observer.\nAn observable reader could switch between four internal states: “Wait for start detection”, “Wait for SE insertion”, “Wait for SE processing”, “Wait for SE removal”.\n At the wait for start detection, the observable reader doesn’t notify any event. The start of the SE detection by an observable reader need to be explicitly requested by an observer by setting a “polling mode” either through a ‘startSeDetection’ or a ‘setDefaultSelectionRequest’ commands. The SE detection could be started for polling mode defined either in “single shot” or “repeating” mode.  In single shot mode, the observable reader stops the detection after the SE removal (back to the wait for start detection). In repeating mode, after the SE removal, the observable reader restart to detect another SE (back to the wait for SE insertion).   Wait for SE insertion, if a SE is inserted or selected, the registered reader observers are notified by the observable reader according to the defined notification mode. The observable reader switches to the wait for SE processing. During the SE processing by the observers, the observable reader waits that an observer acknowledges the end of the SE processing. There are two waits to ends the processing of an observed SE:  Either an observer directly could stop the listening of the observable reader (‘stopSeDetection’ command). The observable reader switches to the wait for start detection, and the observers are immediately notified about the SE remove. Otherwise, the observers could wait for a clean remove of the SE from the observable reader; it’s the SE removal sequence:  When the main reader observer has finished the processing of the SE, it could request the observable reader to wait for the remove of the SE (‘notifySeProcessed’ command). Finally, the reader observers could be notified when the SE is effectively removed. If the SE insertion listening started in the \u0026ldquo;repeating polling mode\u0026rdquo;, then when the SE is removed, the observable reader automatically starts again the listening of a new SE insertion; otherwise a new explicit request to start the SE listening is required to restart the listening.      Secure Element Selection API Selection parameters (Communication protocol, ATR, AID) To select a Secure Element, a SE Selector has to be defined, based on one to three parameters.\n A SE selection could be defined for a specific communication protocol. A SE could be filtered for an ATR (Answer To Reset) matching a specific regular expression. A specific application of a SE could be selected by setting its AID (Application IDentifier).  Selection transaction To operate a transaction with a SE, it should be firstly selected. The aim of the SE selection API is to get a SE resource: a set of a reader with a selected SE.\nA SE Selection is managed in two steps:\n first the “preparations” of selection request based on SE selector, next the “processing” of the selection requests.  In order to manage multiple kinds of SE, several selection requests could be prepared with different selectors.\nDepending on the setting of the reader, the processing of the selection could be operated in two different ways:\n either in a “explicit” way after the checking of the SE presence, or in a ”default” way for an observable reader detecting the insertion of a SE.   cf. “Generic Use Case 1 / Explicit AID Selection” example\ncf. “Generic Use Case 2 / Default Selection Notification” example\n In case a SE Selection is prepared with a channel control mode defined as “keep open”, then the different prepared selectors are operated with the presented SE, but the processing of the selection stops when a selector matches the SE.\n The result of the SE selection could be a single ‘matching SE’: this SE is kept as selected in the reader. It’s possible to directly operate command with the SE.  But if a SE selection has been defined with a channel control mode at “close after”, in this case all the prepared SE selectors are operated whatever the matching result.\n After each selector processing, if a selector has matched, the logical channel with the SE is closed (the SE is no more selected). If several applications of the presented SE have matched the selectors: the result of the processing of SE selections is a list matching SE, but all of them are deselected. To continue the SE processing, the terminal application has to choose one matching SE, and to select it again but in “keep open” channel control mode.   cf. “Generic Use Case 3 / Grouped Multi-Selection” example\n After the selection of a SE, using a SE resource, the terminal can continue by operating a specific transaction with the corresponding SE.\n cf. “Generic Use Case 4 / Sequential Multi-Selection” example\n ","date":1582498800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598438078,"objectID":"3a14153849dc063dadb7ecdf1d71e6bf","permalink":"/keyple-website/docs/architecture-keyplecore/","publishdate":"2020-02-24T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/keyple-website/docs/architecture-keyplecore/","section":"docs","summary":"This high-level API is convenient for developers implementing smart card processing application for terminal interfaced with smart card readers.\nPackages \u0026amp; features The Keyple Core User API is a tool to manage readers, and to select “generic” Secure Elements.","tags":null,"title":"Keyple ‘Core’ – Architecture","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This guide will provide nescessary steps to develop a Keyple plugin for a device.

The FCI response is automatically analyzed in order to identify the revision and the features supported by the Calypso PO. The invalidation status is also checked. The selected Calypso PO object allows to automatically initialize a Calypso PO transaction: high level functional commands could be prepared and processed in order to read or write data in the PO file structure, outside or securely inside a Calypso secure session.    Features Packages   Calypso PO operations Selection of Calypso SE: PO or SAM PO transaction: Read / update of data PO authentication org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.transaction   Calypso PO responses data parsing org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.command.po.parser   Calypso Selection The Calypso API to select a Portable object is an extension of the generic Secure Element selection Core API:\n A PO AID selection could be defined to accept or reject invalidated PO. A request for a SE selection is defined with SE selector containing at least an AID (to operate through a Select Application APDU command) or an ATR filter. A request for a PO selection could be enhanced to operate after the PO selector processing some APDU commands with the PO : Select File or Read Records commands. In case of successful Calypso PO, the matching SE is retuned as a Calypso PO. The Calypso API analyzes the startup information of a Calypso PO in order to identify the kind of product, its revision, the optional features supported, the file structure used. Then for coming PO commands, the setting of the technical parameters automatically managed.  The PO command grouped with the PO selection have to be “prepared” before the processing of a default or explicit SE selection.\n cf. “Calypso Use Case 1 / Explicit AID Selection” example\ncf. “Calypso Use Case 2 / Default Selection Notification” example\n A ‘PO resource’ is the set of a Calypso PO and the reader on which it is selected.\nIn a same way the Calypso APO provides the tool to select a Calypso security module (a SAM). A SAM selector doesn’t support AID. The corresponding matching SE is a Calypso SAM. A Calypso SAM and the reader used for its selection defines a ‘SAM resource’.\nCalypso secure transaction A PO transaction could be operated on a Calypso resource. In case a SAM resource is set, a PO transaction could support the Calypso secure session in order to manage a mutual authentication between the terminal and the Calypso PO.\nThrough the PO transaction API, only the APDU commands for the PO are explicitly defined; the APDU commands for the SAM are automatically built by the library. Two kinds of methods are provided by the API: ‘prepare’ methods, and ‘process’ methods.\n The ‘prepare’ methods allows to define PO file selection and PO data access operations (read or update of records for a specific file, append of record for a cyclic file, increase or decrease of the value of a counter). A ‘process” method sends to the PO at least the previously prepared command.  The process PO commands method could operated only if no secure session is currently open with the PO. If one or several PO commands have been prepared, a single request is done to the PO reader. The process opening method allows to manage the opening of a secure session.  First a single request is operated to the SAM reader in order to set the PO serial as the cryptographic diversifier, and to get the terminal challenge for the session. Then another single request is done to the PO reader to play the prepared PO command, and to manage the opening of the PO session.   A process PO command in session method could be processed only if a secure session is already open with PO.  A single request Is operated with the PO reader to operate the prepared PO commands. Another single request is sent to the SAM reader to update the update the digest of the MAC session.   The process closing method is used to manage the closing of the secure session with the PO.  A first SAM request is operated to update the digest of the last prepared PO commands and to get the terminal session certificate (to save a PO request, the API anticipates the responses of the prepared PO commands). A single PO request is transmitted to run the last prepared PO command, to recover the PO session certificate, and to send the ratification signal if necessary. Finally, a second SAM request allows to authenticate the PO. If the transaction is successful the mutual authentication is valid, and the PO has atomically committed the requested data updates.      The minimal costs of a Calypso secure session are:\n 3 PO requests (1 for the PO selection + 1 for the PO session opening + 1 for the PO session closing). And 3 SAM requests if the SAM is already selected (1 for the PO session opening + 2 for the PO session closing); otherwise 4 SAM requests if the SAM isn’t already selected.  By default, the PO transaction manages the Calypso secure session as ‘atomic’: the cumulative amount of PO updates command can’t exceed the size of the PO session buffer.\n cf. “Calypso Use Case 4 / PO Authentication” example\n The PO transaction could also be defined to allow multiple sessions: in this case the transaction is automatically split in several session as necessary.\n cf. “Calypso Use Case 5 / PO Multiple Session\u0026quot; example\n ","date":1582498800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598438078,"objectID":"1a323d03873d96eaddc1a9c914634012","permalink":"/keyple-website/docs/architecture-keyplecalypso/","publishdate":"2020-02-24T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/keyple-website/docs/architecture-keyplecalypso/","section":"docs","summary":"Packages \u0026amp; features The Keyple Calypso User API is an extension of the Keyple Core User API to manage Calypso Portable Object securely using Calypso SAM:\n The generic Secure Element selection is enhanced for the selection of a Calypso PO.","tags":null,"title":"Keyple Calypso – Architecture","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1597104000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597178635,"objectID":"fa03a070a7674f109bb0672ca51237f7","permalink":"/keyple-website/community/faq/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/keyple-website/community/faq/","section":"community","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"FAQ","type":"community"},{"authors":["Calypso Networks Association"],"categories":["Events"],"content":"On October 17, 2019, we organized the first Meet Up Eclipse Keyple!
