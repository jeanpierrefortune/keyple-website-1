Eclipse Keyple™ is an Eclipse open source project developped and leaded by Calypso Networks Association, which has been the leader in contactless 
electronic ticketing transportation standards since 2003. For many years, our mission has been to create innovative solutions that are fully 
interoperable, reliable, secure, and open. We collaborate with a dynamic network of city leaders and transport authorities that are keen to work 
with system integrators with Calypso standard expertise.
